# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample test data files used across the test suite.

## Files

- `sample_artifact.txt` - Sample text file for signing tests
- `sample_oidc_token.json` - Example OIDC JWT claims
- `sample_ceremony_log.json` - Example ceremony log structure

These fixtures are used by tests when they need concrete example data that doesn't need to be generated dynamically.
